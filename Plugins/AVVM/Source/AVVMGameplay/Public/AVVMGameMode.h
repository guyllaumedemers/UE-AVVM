/**
 *	Class description:
 *
*	AAVVMGameMode is a GFP Receiver who registers with the GameFeatureFramework and react to GFP actions. It expects to receive system specific components depending on your project needs.
 *	
 *	IMPORTANT : Replicated systems SHOULD BE managed through a component added via GFP. Unreal's USubsystem derived classes CANNOT be replicated! Doing this approach makes for a more modular system
 *	due to component addition and removal no longer requiring hard references in the Actor derived class.
 *
 *	Note : for your UI systems. We expect to push an AVVMComponent with a pre-defined list of UAVVMPresenter class on it! Additionally, by implementing the api defined in the interface below,
 *	you will be able to forward gameplay information without creating dependencies between modules. However, it comes with a price due to interface dispatch!
