/**
 *	Plugin Description :
 *
 *	AVVMGameplay is a CORE system that setup requirements so to properly use the AVVM plugin and it's features.
 *	It expects GameFeatures to target relevant Actors defined here, and dynamically add content :
 *
 *		Example :
 *
 *			* GFP_AddComponent<UAVVMModelComponent> -> AVVMPlayerState
 *			* GFP_AddDataMetaSources
 *			* etc...
 *
 *		Most important here for our UI system is pushing the UAVVMModelComponent Class, defined in BP, and allow the creation of
 *		our UAVVMPresenter Object who respond to the AVVM Notification system.
 *
 *	Additionally,
 *
 *	This system offers a base for any Data definition types, favoring Data driven systems, and a Resource Manager system that will
 *	handle Async loading of your resources (for any AModularActor type).
 *
 *	It defines it's own AbilitySystemComponent and InputMapping Component for handling OnPawnPosses situation where Abilities and InputMappingContext
 *	require a full refresh in respond to gameplay.
 *
 *	IMPORTANT :
 *
 *	Be aware that these actors will be available on both : Server and Client! Presenters dynamically added via the GPF_AddComponent will however
 *	not be present on the Server! (if configured properly)
