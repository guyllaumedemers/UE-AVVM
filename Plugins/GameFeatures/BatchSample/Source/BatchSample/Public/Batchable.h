/**
 *	Class description:
 *
 *	UBatchable is an Interface Class that binds a user to a batching context. This allow
 *	removal behaviour if ever the batchable implementer require removal from the context
 *	due to runtime events that occur.
 *
 *	example : we have a collection of ammo on the ground for pick ups. Nobody ever pick them.
 *	We attempt batch destroying them. A player pass-by and pick up, before the process complete
 *	and destroy the batch.
