/**
 *	Class description:
 *
 *	UActorItemProgressionComponent is a CORE component of the inventory system for progression support. It is added
 *	dynamically at Runtime by the inventory system to a UItemObject to prevent direct reference on Actor type which may not
 *	be defined under this GFP.
 *
 *	UItemObject may refer to registry id pointing to Actor type that exist only in external GFP. Based on this restriction,
 *	the progression system dynamically add itself to the Item Actor and apply progression information to the Actor in a
 *	more flexible fashion.
