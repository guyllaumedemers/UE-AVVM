/**
 *	Plugin Description :
 *
 *	InventorySample is a system that define specific details about what an Inventory would look like in a game. Traditional inventory system
 *	seems to be generally answering a single need, define what the UPlayer holds on them. But, as I'm thinking about it, the general use of this
 *	system can be broader.
 *
 *		Here's how...
 *
 *		This plugin doesn't restrict itself to the standard inventory system we usually think about, any AActor could own the UActorComponent supporting
 *		the inventory system, which means any Actor could hold a collection of Items i.e AShop, AMysteryChess, AForge, etc...
 *		and they could all have data driven collection of items (or dynamic if provided from backend services).
 *
 *	This system has the benefit of allowing two components of similar type to exchange content, allow actions like trading, buying, etc... It unify
 *	the api under a single roof, removing the need for systems like Shop/Forge/etc... and simplify how the UI system would request the relevant data for multi-context display.
 *
 *		Example :
 *
 *			* Displaying side-by-side AShop items and UPlayer 1 inventory.
 *			* Displaying side-by-side UPlayer 1 inventory and UPlayer 1 Backup Storage.
 *			* Displaying side-by-side UPlayer 1 inventory and UPlayer 2 inventory.
 *			* or just displaying UPlayer 1 inventory in a singular window context.
 *
 *	Note : This system expect to make direct calls to the HandshakeSample GFP for running validations!
