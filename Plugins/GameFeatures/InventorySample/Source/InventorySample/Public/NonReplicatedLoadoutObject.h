/**
 *	Class description:
 *
 *	UNonReplicatedLoadoutObject is a strategy UObject that define the behaviour of a user loadout, and manage
 *	items 'equip' state.
 *
 *	Note : AI may extend this for more advance combat feature, so in-combat behaviour can change
 *	weapons based on inventory defined on Pawn.
 *
 *	Important : Item swapping, or cycling expect simulated events to happen both on Server and Client
 *	as the state of this object isnt expected to be replicated.
 *
 *		Example : AbilityTask_MouseWheelEvent. (*not an actual class*)
